/// A wrapper for unsafely aliased memory locations.
///
/// `AliasedCell' makes sure that its inner value
/// is completely inaccessible from safe code.
/// Once an `AliasedCell` has been constructed from some value,
/// until the value is moved out again with the (unsafe) `into_inner()` method,
/// the only way to access the wrapped value
/// is through the unsafe `alias_mut()` method.
///
/// This is useful for FFI calls that take raw pointers as input,
/// and hold on to them even after returning control to the caller.
/// Since Rust's type system is not aware of such aliases,
/// it cannot provide the usual guarantees about validity of pointers
/// and exclusiveness of mutable pointers.
/// This means that any code that has access to the memory in question
/// is inherently unsafe as long as such untracked aliases exist.
/// Putting the value in an `AliasedCell` before the FFI call,
/// and only taking it out again
/// once the caller has ensured that all aliases have been dropped
/// (most likely through another FFI call),
/// makes certain that any such unsafe access to the aliased value
/// can only happen from code marked as `unsafe`.
///
/// An `AliasedCell` should never be simply dropped in normal use.
/// Rather, it should always be freed explicitly with `into_inner()`,
/// signalling that there are no outstanding aliases anymore.
/// When an `AliasedCell` is dropped unexpectedly,
/// we have to assume that it likely still has untracked aliases,
/// and thus freeing the memory would probably be unsound.
/// Therefore, the `drop()` implementation of `AliasedCell`
/// leaks the inner value instead of freeing it;
/// and throws a panic.
/// Leaking the memory, while undesirable in general,
/// keeps the memory accessible to any outstanding aliases.
/// This is the only way to retain soundness during unwinding,
/// or when the panic gets caught.
///
/// Note that making FFI access through untracked aliases
/// requires the value to have a stable memory location --
/// typically by living on the heap rather than on the stack.
/// If the value isn't already in a heap-allocated container
/// such as `Box<>`, `Vec<>`, or `String`,
/// it is the caller's responsibility to wrap it in a `Box<>` explicitly.
/// `AliasedCell` itself cannot ensure that the address remains stable
/// when the `AliasedCell` gets moved around.
